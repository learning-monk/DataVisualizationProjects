# Box plot example with D3.js

**This box plot analyzes distribution of Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width of species setosa, versicolor and virginica from Iris dataset.**

I built this chart using the base code from the link below. However, I have made several changes to this code to make it user friendly and improve aesthetics.

I would like to thank **Yan Holtz** for providing the base code.

## Improvements:

- A drop down selection has been provided so that user can select an attribute to analyze.
- Color aesthetics have been improved to make it more appealing to the user.

## To interact with the chart, please check this codepen.
