**This example is based on Mike Bostock's Sortable bar chart code (https://observablehq.com/@d3/sortable-bar-chart#chart) implemented using my own logic.**

- You can find the data from the link below:
  https://gist.githubusercontent.com/learning-monk/96c71857dcfc348ecbcda5cb4a90163a/raw/69fa895f7b5f2d99d236762969c46b1a9c47604a/alphabet.csv

- This data is about frequency of letters used.

- Select from the drop down how the bars to be sorted. Currently, there are three options available - Alphabetically, Descendingly (by frequency) and Ascendingly (by frequency).

- The higher frequency letter is highlighted in yellow.
